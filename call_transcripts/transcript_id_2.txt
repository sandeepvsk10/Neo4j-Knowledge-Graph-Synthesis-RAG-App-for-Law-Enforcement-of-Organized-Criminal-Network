Transcript 2: "Friday, 6:50 PM – Snippet Between Mathew and Walter"
Walter:
South Warehouse was tight. I counted the bundles—Alpha batch is clean.

Mathew:
I did my sweep ten past. Bricks came in blue-sealed. Same format as last Southbound.

Walter:
Derek pinged me—says he's meeting Southpaw again. College Park. Same time as last drop.

Mathew:
Oak Ridge first?

Walter:
Yeah. Quick handoff, then Park at 6:45. High level.

Mathew:
Coded phones?

Walter:
All him. Said it’s for “Drop Night”. I don’t ask.

Mathew:
Southpaw runs quiet. But those meet times? Always sync too perfectly.

Walter:
We’re cogs. He's the pattern.
