Transcript 1: "Wednesday, 9:12 PM – Call Between Sam and Tom"
Sam:
North Warehouse was quieter than usual. Dropped the crates around 8. Oversaw the whole load-in.

Tom:
You stash the gear?

Sam:
Yeah—SMGs. Concealed ‘em under the second rack. Ghost-style.

Tom:
Nice. I got there ten past. Inventorying the AKs.
Boss wants the list tight. No slip-ups.

Sam:
Southpaw said that?

Tom:
Didn’t say it directly. Clicked his ring and pointed. You know how he does it.

Sam:
He still using College Park?

Tom:
Only for top-line meets. You know how locked that place is.

Sam:
I’m staying clear. You stick to arms. I’ll handle the bricks.

Tom:
Say less. Keep your Ghost mode on.
